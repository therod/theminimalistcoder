description: "Customers are not interested in your solution. They are only interested in their problems. So what job is your product or service solving? How does it make your customers’ lives better?  I want to learn more about this way of thinking about building products and services, that's why I started a [Jobs To Be Done Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/jobs-to-be-done-meetup-switzerland/) here in Switzerland."

# Introduction
*“Customers are not interested in your solution. They are only interested in their problems.”* So what job is your product or service solving? How does it make your customers' lives better?

![Progress Jobs to be Done](https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/d/b/0/5/600_463196069.jpeg)

Deeply inspired by Alan Klements' "[When Coffee and Kale Compete](http://www.whencoffeeandkalecompete.com)" and Kathy Sierras' "[Badass: Making Users Awesome](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920036593.do)" we want to bring a new way of thinking to how we develop products. By focusing on the desire every customer has to improve themselves and how customers image their lives being better when they have the right solution.

This page is a representation of everything that I've learned along the way learning and applying #JTBD style thinking in my daily work designing and building products.

If you live in Switzerland make sure to [join our Meetup Group](https://www.meetup.com/jobs-to-be-done-meetup-switzerland/)!

#### Quotes
> Growth comes from the struggling moments that we choose, to make things better.
> If there's no struggle, there is no growth. __I can create the best thing in the world, but if they are not struggling, they are never going to get that thing.__  – Bob Moesta

> I can learn more in ten interviews than in a thousand surveys. – Bob Moesta


# Customer Interviews

## About customer interviews
One of the most helpful tools in the #JTBD area is the customer interview. [Mastering Jobs-To-Be-Done Interview](http://learn.jobstobedone.org/courses/JTBDinterviews) is the best way to start to learn about how to conduct #JTBD style interviews yourself.
The course costs 300$ USD and is totally worth it.

## Conducting interviews

### Before the Interview
Before each interview I like to quickly skim through the [Jobs-to-be-Done Handbook](https://www.amazon.de/Jobs-be-Done-Handbook-techniques-application/dp/1499339232/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&qid=1516729033&sr=8-4&keywords=jobs+to+be+done). It's a great refresher.

#### Quotes
> It's not a process it's not steps. People think the process is the magic bullet and it's the thing that is letting everybody down.
> Because they haven't done the reps on the skill. They feel like: "if I study how to ride a bike, I will know how to ride one." No, you have to fall of the bike a few times, you have to do these things and learn how to get good at these things, we don't have to just study these things.
> To be a good innovator you have to learn these skills, not necessarily just the process.
> – Bob Moesta
