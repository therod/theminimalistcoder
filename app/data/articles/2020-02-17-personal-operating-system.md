## Core Principle - Live the via negativa

## How to eat

### Eat real food, mostly from the animal kingdom

### Remove plant foods completely

#### Why we think plants are healthy

#### Avoid vegetable oils

#### If you identify as a Vegan
- Think about why you are Vegan.
- If you don't give a shit about animal -> Rethink your position
- If you care more about the animals than your personal health -> your choice, but at least read something about that
- If you do it because of the environment -> See the other side of the argument
- It's more profitable for big corporations if people go vegan. (Shelf life)

#### Ditch Coffee & Tea

### Eat when hungry

### Fast 5 days every 3 months

### Move your body

### Train 3 days a week

### Pick-up martial arts (especially if you're low on assertiveness)

### Embrace Kaizen (1% better every day)

### Keep a simple todo system. Create MITs and shallow work tasks.

#### Use Weekly / Daily Goals

### Journaling & Meditation

### Adopt a practical life philosophy and iterate over it. (Read about the Stoics)

### Apply the Pareto Principle

### Read about Microdosing

### OTHER
Identify the few critical tasks that contribute most to income and schedule
them with very short and clear deadlines. If you haven't identified the
mission-critical tasks and set aggressive start and end times for their
completion, the unimportant becomes the important.
