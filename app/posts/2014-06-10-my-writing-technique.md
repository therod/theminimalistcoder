Last night I was lying in bed, thinking about the "art" of writing blog posts. Well, to be more precise: I was reflecting on my current technique which helps me write blog posts faster and more clearly. 

This will be a short post. View it as a random thought that popped up in my head and wich I wanted to share with you.

> Side note:
Situations like this are also a reason why I keep a pen and piece of paper within reach of my bed. You will thank yourself later if you write down ideas right away, no matter how unimportant they might seem.

The most simple way for me to compose a new blog post, is to imagine that I talk to another person while I'm writing. This might sound obvious to some of you, but for me this was a huge discovery when I first started out writing in english.

As I write this article I constantly imagine that I'm telling the things you read right now to another person. While I'm speaking, I transcribe my spoken words in real time onto the page. 

That way I tend to only talk about stuff that I genuinely know and always try to make it through the whole conversation without interruption. If I keep getting stuck it's a sign for me to stop, check if I've done my research and maybe rethink what message I'm trying to convey to the reader.

I guess this is also a great way to let ones natural "voice" shine through while writing.

But hey, what the fuck do I know about writing anyway?
