    bio:
      about: |
        I've been self-employed for over 10 years. Until now, I dedicated most of that
        time designing and writing software products to solve problems I care
        about.

        My biggest dedication in life is to explore new topics and think deeply about things. These range from [movement](/articles/movement), [nutrition](/articles/ketogenic-diet) over [Stoic philosophy](/articles/stoic-tapas) to [psychology](https://courses.jordanbpeterson.com/personality) and the collective unconscious.

        These days I'm captivated by the [works](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung_publications) of [C. G. Jung](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung) and their implications on my day-to-day work.

        You can get in touch with me [here](/contact).
